# Early Days Programming

Welcome, this folder contains my early 'projects' as a noobie programmer, I have created a folder which has simple algorithms I coded when starting to learn python.

## Purpose

I wanted to keep record of my noobie programming days becuase I can look back and reflect on my improvement, see how how my coding skills have improved and changed since then.
